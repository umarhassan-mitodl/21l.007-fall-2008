Course Assignments
------------------

**Revision handout 1** ({{% resource_link 22e1c5c1-0c7e-f04a-14b8-d9613d0b8ecf "PDF" %}})  
General guidelines, sample introductions. Note: this handout was prepared for an earlier version of the class, so the examples will be based on unfamiliar texts.

**Revision handout 2** ({{% resource_link abb14b9d-d0a5-f860-8fe1-18a1db4db375 "PDF" %}})  
More on how introductions relate to the rest of an essay, with examples. Note: this handout was prepared for another subject, so the texts will again be unfamiliar.

**Close analysis sample** ({{% resource_link 3c47da5c-b096-0058-5746-8da5ebd630a3 "PDF" %}})  
As promised, I've written up a 3 page sample with a few comments.

**Guide to close reading** ({{% resource_link d14006fe-81f0-f0b8-7289-594f16972d2a "PDF" %}})  
Here is a "how-to," produced for this class last fall by Prof. Sarah Brouillette, with a few modifications for our use.

**Writing workshop guidelines** ({{% resource_link 833f1e68-1baa-0dc6-cbb6-4cf0f360e9ff "PDF" %}})  
Comments on the issues you raised, an analysed rough draft, and a more polished draft with notes towards revision/comparison.

Informal Writing
----------------

This consists of two sections. The first section contains 500-700 words and identifies and discusses an object that 1/ relates to the events or places described in one of our texts; 2/ changes our understanding by telling us something the text doesn't. The second section is a response **either** to Worsley reading for Ses #23 or to Erdrich's _Books and Islands_ for Ses #25.

Group Work/Presentations
------------------------

Each group will be in charge of leading 2 days of discussion, which means you will prepare a presentation on the readings and design activities and discussion questions that you think appropriate to the material and to your topic; meet as a group at least once with the Writing Advisor, to plan and get feedback; generate and lead the subsequent discussion. Part of your presentation should be a hand-out with a bibliography of sources.

Using Sources
-------------

If you use secondary sources (criticism, history, etc.) in your essays, these sources must be acknowledged and properly cited either parenthetically in a footnote. Citation is necessary even if you do not quote a source word for word. **This includes internet sources!** Writing is almost always a collaborative process at some level, but failure to respect the intellectual property of others counts as plagiarism.

Essays should be handed in by the date and time specified in the assignment; the final grade will be reduced by late completion. Chronic lateness or repeated absences from class (more than three) will be further reflected in your grade, after notice to you and at my discretion.
